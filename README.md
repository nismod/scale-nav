## Introduction

This is a python module that helps change scales of spatial data sets.
It relies on the [H3](https://h3geo.org) hexagonal grid’s hierarchical
indexing functionalities and aims to add to that the data
transformations that need to be done when navigating between levels of
the hierarchy.
