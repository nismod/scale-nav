    "# A OOP approach to hierarchically indexed data tables \n",
    "This notebook defines the schema and relations that will be implemented to facilitate the workflows projecting global data sets on a hierarchical index and manipulating different layers together. \n",
    "Mainly, this approach aims to solve the following challenges:\n",
    "- User friendly : ideally have a familiar sytax to pandas users\n",
    "- Scalable : be able to work with national, continetal and even global data sets of fine spatial resolution (ex: 100m,1000m grids)\n",
    "- Flexible : it should provide a easily exportable type of data to use across different types of processes and analyses.\n",
