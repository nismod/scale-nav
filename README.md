Navigating spatial scales
================

## Introduction

This is a python module that helps change scales of spatial data sets.
It relies on the [H3](https://h3geo.org) hexagonal gridâ€™s hierarchical
indexing functionalities and adds to that the data
transformations that need to be done when navigating between levels of
the hierarchy under certain constraints and prior knowledge about the underlying data.
